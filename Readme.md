# Analysis

- Results can be replicated by running the script ```results.R```.  
- Anonymized survey data for Study 1 can be found in ```data/study/study1_results.csv```. The data contains responses from the 78 (of 80) survey respondents, one respondent per row.  The other files in the ```data/study``` directory are simply used to list out the experimental details in a convenient human and machine readable form.
